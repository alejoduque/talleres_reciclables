Inspiration arrives from the writings of Gabriel Garcia Marquez (nobel prize YEAR? + which texts?) Such readings motivate a research on ways to integrate the sphere of magical realism as a to get a hold and traceroute other possible ways for crossing wisdoms in our daily networks.

This project aims for an exchange of know.hows between young programmers and artists from Colombia (south america) and Switzerland  (Europe).

Ooperating via network streams, we will set up to gather, distribute and learn together in the time of the digital networks what TV and radio still mean in terms of socio culutural networks.

Conscious that we live in an interconnected world, doing a revision of satellite technology is a must. 

It will be the way to create a festival outside of a festival(readme100 offshoring and nourishing far from its statements, beyond its basic propositions), if elected, we will use the money (500euros) to set up an open call in the L.U.G's (linux user groups) mailing lists and support the free software agents in far away continents.

We will document and edit a text (article) that will reflect the potentialities and drives towards "insurgent" practices, those that intrinsically belong to the essence of network and collide interestingly in a country with a renowned infamous tradition on trafficking and smuggling: Colombia (we will pay close attention to trace ideas related with electronic borders, demilitarized zones and servers, i.p's black holes, replicators, virtual tunnels, etc.)

The result of this feedback research will serve to address the following question:

Some part of South America faces its sell-out signing a treaty called TCL, (Tratado de Libre Comercio) Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and the U.S.A. This countries are basically forced to agree in points that will allow genetical appropiation and exploitation by North American corporations. Via the patenting figure they (U.S.A) will steal the basic wisdoms of ancient cultures. It's not only about drugs, but about plants, animals and perhaps even water resources. This is anyway old news since its been taking place since the encounter of pre-colombian cultures with the Spanish colonizers some 500 years ago.

Ilegality raises the price of drugs, so in the particular case of cocaine its better to keep them ilegal and avoid talking about them in these TCL treaty, but ironically drugs are the one produce that represents more income to both parts is not a topic to be consider in the tables that define the conditions for this treaty.



Alejandro Duque (kolumbien)
Researchs on the topic of smuggling knowledge and ideas accross the networks for a PhD dissertation at http://www.egs.edu , 
Paying particular attention to the "hacks" that a resourceful mind does to all kinds of new or old techno conceptual devices. 
(very often we find examples hidden under criminal records, like those of the drug trafficking techniques). 
A collaborative  to develop a way to interface place, location and trajectory with audiovisual representations...so called "real-time mapping".
